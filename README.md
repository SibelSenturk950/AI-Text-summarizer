#  AI Text Summarizer using BART

This project is a simple text summarization tool powered by Hugging Face's Transformers. It uses the BART (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`) model to generate concise summaries of long texts. NLTK is used to split long inputs into manageable chunks for better results.

##  Features
- Summarizes long or short texts
- Handles inputs longer than the modelâ€™s maximum length by chunking
- Easy to use, extend, and integrate

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`)
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

##  Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
